The Book of CAD  
Everything from how to use it to how to turn it into your ally

By Diarmuid Óg Murphy

Introduction (PLEASE READ \- DO NOT SKIP)  
CAD \- Ever heard of it?  If not, don’t worry, that’ll just make this even more enjoyable.  
	First of all, what is CAD?  CAD (short for Computer Aided Design) is a computer software that allows you to design anything you want within the physical world.  It’s kind of like blender but real.  CAD is key to any design.  Long ago (about 50 years ago and before), people had to design products by drawing them over and over again on graph paper.  Don’t get me wrong, this method is still useful, but CAD allows us to speed up this once very long process by being very flexible and easy to change.  With CAD, sketching, designing, finalizing and saving are just a few clicks away.  Not already hooked?  Let me get more into what this book is really all about.  This book is a reference book, meaning that it has answers to many common problems that fellow CADDERS like yourself fall into everyday.  You will not only find explanations written by the authors, but also links that will take you to youtubers who are far more equipped at explaining these topics than I am.  There will be two sections \- The Training Section and the Reference Section.  If you have no experience with CAD whatsoever or do but not with specifically Fusion 360 (the free program that Team 5171 uses), then I suggest you start at the training section, which will go through step by step where to download Fusion 360 , how to build beams and download and insert files into CAD all the way to how to make your first joint.  If you already have some experience with Fusion 360 or are a seasoned pro with the platform, then the reference section is for you.  There, you will find a great many tutorials and explanations going through the many different levels of Fusion 360\.  In a way, the training section is also part of the reference section as it goes through essential-to- understand topics that even the most experienced CAD designers may forget from time to time, so please do not hesitate at all to use it as that too is part of this book.  While there are no explanations as of yet, there will be soon.  This book is a work in progress, and the writers of it will change as the years go by, but one thing will stay the same forever; this book will always stand to you when you use Fusion 360 and even perhaps some other CADDING Platforms when it comes to the basics.  I wish you luck in your future endeavors with CAD and may you come out of using the platform in one piece \- I know you’ll do great.🙂
