## Getting Started

First things first: we need to get your machine ready to talk to the robot.

1.  **Download the Software:** Grab the WPILib Installer [from here](https://docs.wpilib.org/en/latest/docs/zero-to-robot/step-2/wpilib-setup.html).
2.  **Install Java:** The installer should handle this, but make sure you're using the version specified for the 2026 season.

## Pro-Tips for the 2026 Season

*   **Commit Often:** Don't wait until the end of the day. Small, frequent commits make it easier to track changes and fix bugs.
*   **Keep it Modular:** Write functions for reuse. If you find yourself copying and pasting code, it should probably be its own method or class.
*   **Ask for Help:** FRC is a team sport. If you're stuck for more than 20 minutes, grab a teammate or a mentor!

Happy coding, and let's make the 2026 season our best one yet!
