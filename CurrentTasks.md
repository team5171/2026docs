Message from Mentor Kevin:

> The software team can start by reading through the WPILib docs. Now that everyone has GitHub access, they can also look at last year’s robot code. The driver station laptop and robot are all set up if they want to drive it around.

> It could be a good exercise to review the robot code to understand which buttons do what. Just be careful not to run any autonomous routines.
